This agent model of HIV infection incorporates cell death, proliferation and activation to generate HIV clones of varying sizes from primary HIV infection, through a time period with no antiretroviral therapy (ART), followed by a period of ART. At a set of times during ART, the latent reservoir is sampled to provide an in silico representation of the reservoir sampling of two patients (Patients 1 and 3) from Maldarelli et al., Science, 2014.

The main program is constructed to either provide a summary output or the full output of the calculations. 
The summary output is useful to determine parameters that reasonably produce the patient clonal sampling profiles, by being run on a computational cluster where the particular parameter set is input from a file myindex.dat where myindex=1,...,N for N separate parameter sets. The value of myindex is assumed generated by the cluster. In that case the output is sent to separate csv files for each value of myindex.
Once a reasonable parameter set has been determined, the full output can then be generated. The output is around 5GB and saved in a .mat file. So best not to run too many of these.

The main file is Clone_agents_github_main.m and this calls all the function files.
